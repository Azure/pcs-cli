Azure IoT PCS CLI Overview
==========================

Command Line Interface for deploying an [Azure IoT Solution Accelerator](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com) into a
user's Azure subscription.

An IoT Solution Accelerator is open source implementation of common IoT solution patterns that can be
deployed to Azure using an Azure subscription. Each solution combines custom code and services to
implement a specific IoT scenario or scenarios. Any of the solutions can be customized to meet any
specific requirements. Visit [azureiotsolutions.com](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com) for more
details or to deploy using the GUI.

### Solution Types

This CLI has the ability to deploy the following solution types:

1. Remote Monitoring.
1. Device Simulation.
   
### Features

This CLI has the ability to deploy the following configurations of solutions:

1. [basic](#basic) - deploys all resources to a single VM.
1. [standard](#standard) - deploys resources using Azure Kubernetes Service.
1. [local](#local) - deploys resources to be used for running and debugging microservices locally.

Deployment Options
==================
> These are available for `remotemonitoring` solution type only.

## Overview

When deploying the preconfigured solution, there are several options that configure the deployment process:

| Option | Values | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| SKU    | `basic`, `standard`, `local` | A _basic_ deployment is intended for test and demonstrations, it deploys all the microservices to a single virtual machine. A _standard_ deployment is intended for production, it deploys the microservices to multiple virtual machines. A _local_ deployment configures a Docker container to run the microservices locally, and uses Azure services, such as storage and Cosmos DB, in the cloud. |
| Runtime | `dotnet`, `java` | Selects the language implementation of the microservices. |

To learn about how to use the local deployment, see [Running the remote monitoring solution locally](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/wiki/Running-the-Remote-Monitoring-Solution-Locally#deploy-azure-services-and-set-environment-variables).

## Basic

The purpose of the basic deployment is to demo the capabilities of the system
and requires minimal setup, deploying all resources to a single VM.

Creating a basic solution will result in the following Azure services being
provisioned into the subscription:

| Resource                       | Used For  |
|--------------------------------|-----------|
| [Linux Virtual Machine][virtual-machines]  | Hosting microservices |
| [Azure IoT Hub][iot-hub]                   | Device management and communication |
| [Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-db]               | Stores configuration data, and device telemetry like rules, alerts, and messages |
| [Azure Storage Account][storage-account]   | Storage for checkpoints |
| [Azure Stream Analytics][stream-analytics] | Transforms data into messages and alerts<br/>Processes and stores telemetry, and create alarms |
| [Azure Event Hub][event-hub]               | Used for device notifications |
| [App Service][web-application]             | Application gateway with valid SSL certificate |

## Standard

The standard deployment is a production-ready deployment a developer can
customize and extend to meet their needs. The standard deployment option should be used when
ready to customize a production-ready architecture, built for scale and
extensibility. Application microservices are built as Docker containers and deployed using AKS. The orchestrator is
responsible for deployment, scaling, and management of the application.

Creating a standard solution will result in the following Azure services being
provisioned into the subscription:

| Resource                                      | Used For |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| [Azure IoT Hub][iot-hub]                      | Device management, command and control |
| [Azure Kubernetes Service][kubernetes-service]| Use a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestration service, defaults to 3 agents|
| [Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-db]                  | Stores configuration data, and device telemetry like rules, alerts, and messages |
| [Azure Storage Accounts][storage-account]     | 4 for VM storage, and 1 for the streaming checkpoints |
| [Azure Stream Analytics][stream-analytics]    | Transforms data into messages and alerts<br/>Processes and stores telemetry, and create alarms |
| [App Service][web-application]                | Application gateway with valid SSL certificate |

## Local
The purpose of the local deployment is to deploy the minimal set of services required to set up
the solution for local development.

Creating a local deployment will result in the following Azure services being
provisioned into the subscription:

| Resource                                   | Used For  |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------|
| [Azure IoT Hub][iot-hub]                   | Device management and communication |
| [Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-db]               | Storing configuration data, and device telemetry like rules, alerts, and messages |
| [Azure Storage Account][storage-account]   | Storage for checkpoints |

> Pricing information for these services can be found
[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing). Usage amounts and billing details
for a subscription can be found in the
[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

Kubernetes
=============

## Prerequisites

Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-using-curl)

## Dashboard


`kubectl proxy` to view Kubernetes dashboard that will start a local
web proxy for your cluster (it will start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy/):
