# Solution: remote monitoring

# Important:
# 1. The script runs in an environment with old/strict shell support, so don't rely on Bash niceties
# 2. The script is designed NOT to throw errors, to avoid secrets ending in azureiotsolutions.com logs
# 3. In case of errors, the script terminates with exit code "1" which must be caught by the deployment service to inform the user.
# 4. The script invokes setup.sh script and checks for errors returned by the script, logging to a file in the VM.

# Enable this for debugging only
